        <h2>Understanding the GrowFix</h2> <br> <br>
        <p class="title">For understanding GrowFix and its vision & mission, it’s really important to know the journey & methodology of product creation. <br>

            For me, getting clarification & understanding about the product was going through news, product videos, and podcasts. <br>
            
            - I read news/blogs to understand the vision/mission, knowledge about the founders/investors, and user's needs for GrowFix. <br>
            
            - For understanding the product, how it works? and how the product is solving the problem of investment for the people, I watched GrowFix videos multiple times to get a deeper understanding of the product without missing a point. <br>
            
            - Podcast really helped me to understand the founder's journey and the reason behind creating such low risk and higher return investment products as compare to FDs (Low Risk & Low Returns) and Mutual Funds (High Risk but High Returns). <br>
            
            - A literature review from the internet helped me to get understanding the terms like Liquidity, Loans, FDs, Mutual Funds, Retail Investors, Low-Risk Investment, NBFCs, Collaterals, Rating Agency, Selling & buying, Demat Account</p> <br> <br>

            <h1 class="text">“UX Design is not about getting requirements and <br> 
                completing them. It’s more about understanding the <br>
                 business, user’s problems and producing a more valuable <br>
                  experience for them”</h1>

            <h3>colors</h3><br>
            <p>Blue is the most popular preferred color among men. It suggests intelligence or serenity. Dark blue evokes luxury, and light blues are refreshing. <br>
                 It is highly used among banks and financial institutions.</p><br>
            <p>Green. Green is the color of money. If we use green in our website design we may be giving off a subconscious feeling of wealth.</p><br>

                <p>A sketch of the logo helps to understand the business and their process so using colors and visualisation  of the vision helps users to <br>
                     understand the brand in one view.</p><br><br>
